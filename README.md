Calculators
===========

Welcome to my open source social experiment. The idea is to start with a basic interface that anyone can implement,
and see what a community can build.

I encourage you to fork and contribute in every way you can imagine:
* Implement the interface
* Unit tests
* UI
* you can even add this page...

I decided to start with the basic interface ICalculator (i guess that most of us used it in some test applications)


Have fun!
